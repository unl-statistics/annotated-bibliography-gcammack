thesis: Algorithmic fairness cannot be fully captured by mathematical definitions alone as fairness depends on policy goals, data choices, and value judgments that are made outiside mathmatical models.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
- Introduction: 
  - Purpose: explains why algorithmic fairness matters and why people care about it now.
  - support: It gives examples like criminal justice and lending and explains that fairness is not just a math problem but also a social one

- Assumtions: 
  - Purpose: shows fairness problems start before any model is built
  - support: explains how choices can make a system unfair even if the model itself seems fair

- Setup:
  - Purpose: sets up the basic framework and definitions used later in the paper
  - support: defines things like terms so the authors can talk about fairness in a clear way

- Flavors of Fairness:
  - Purpose: Explains different fairness definitions that only use observed data
  - support: goes through metrics like error rates and demographic parity and shows how each one measures fairness

- Additional context:
  - Purpose: shows that not all fairness definitions can be satisfied at the same time
  - support: shows math examples like COMPAS to explain why improving fairness in one way can make worse in another

- Way forward:
  - Purpose: introdtion of fairness ideas that use more than just statistics
  - support: discusses individual and causal fairness and explains why these approaches are useful but hard to use

-Conclusion:
  - Purpose: wraps up the main points of the paper
  - support: reminds the reader that fairness cannot be solved with one formula and that people need to be clear about their intent
