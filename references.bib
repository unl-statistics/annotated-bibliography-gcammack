	abstract = {Nuance is not a virtue of good sociological theory. Although often demanded and superficially attractive, nuance inhibits the abstraction on which good theory depends. I describe three “nuance traps” common in sociology and show why they should be avoided on grounds of principle, aesthetics, and strategy. The argument is made without prejudice to the substantive heterogeneity of the discipline.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how to modify the naive Bayes classifier in order to perform classification that is restricted to be independent with respect to a given sensitive attribute. Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.},

	volume = {11},
	issn = {1052-7001},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/24833783},
	shorttitle = {Lessons Learned},
	abstract = {There remains strong concern that, even after several years of intense scrutiny, lending discrimination persists. The concerns encompass issues of lending denial disparities, use of predatory lending tactics, and potential disparate impact arising from increased use of credit scoring. This article specifically addresses disparate treatment of loan applications by analyzing data collected in fair lending examinations conducted at national banks during the period 1994 through mid-1999. This information will be useful to banks interested in monitoring their performance, to consumers interested in determining factors that influence their ability to purchase homes, and to policy makers concerned with discrimination issues. We find that statistical analysis can be used successfully to identify patterns of discrimination and that custom modeling, used to reflect an individual bank's underwriting policies, is most effective for that purpose and we discuss variables found to be most predictive of the lending decision. We also suggest potential improvements in the examination of fair lending and identify areas that deserve additional research, given improved data availability.},
